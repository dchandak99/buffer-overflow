# Buffer Overflow Attacks and Defenses

## Highlights
- Demonstrated the Stack based and Heap based buffer overflow exploits along with their special cases: Return to LibC, Off by One and Use after Free using **C** and **x86**.  
- Performed a detailed case study on the Code Red Worm which was based on buffer overflow.

- It contains the descriptions of Stack & Heap based Buffer Attacks (and their various types).  
- It also describes the various techniques for defense.  
- We have also done a detailed case study on the Code Red Worm which was based on the buffer overflow exploit.  

## Types Implemented
- [Stack Based](Stack_based)
- [Heap Based](Heap_based)
- [Return to Libc](ret2libc)
- [Toy Password example](toy_passwd)

## Details
